#' Check weights
#'
#' Helper function to check a weights vector. Makes sure the weights
#' are positive numeric values (not all zeros) and of the same length as the
#' dependent variable \code{dep_var}. Replaces all \code{NA}s with 0 and sets
#' all weights to 1 if weights is set to NULL.
#'
#' @param dep_var dependent variable of distributional function.
#'                Can be any discrete or continuous vector of length 1 or more.
#' @param weights positive numeric vector of \code{length(dep_var)}
#'                containing the weights or \code{NULL}.
#'
#' @return positive numeric vector of \code{length(dep_var)}
#'         containing the checked weights. If \code{weights = NULL}, all weights are set to 1.
