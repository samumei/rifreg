\title{Plot Coefficients for an \code{rifreg} Object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{rifreg}(
  x,
  varselect = NULL,
  confidence_level = 0.05,
  vcov = sandwich::sandwich,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class "rifreg", usually, a result of a call to [rifreg()] with code{statistic = "quantiles"}.}

\item{varselect}{vector of length 1 or more containig the names of the covariates to display.}

\item{confidence_level}{numeric value between 0 and 1 (default = 0.95) that defines the confidence interval
plotted as a ribbon and defined as \code{qnorm(confidence_level/2)} * standard error.}

\item{vcov}{Function to estimate covariance matrix of rifreg coefficients if covariance matrix has not been bootstrapped.
Per default, heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC) standard errors are calculated using [sandwich::sandwich]. Note: These
standard errors do not take the variance introduced by estimating RIF into account.}

\item{...}{other parameters to be passed through to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
a ggplot containing the coefficients for each (selected) covariate
}
\description{
Coefficients are plotted for each quantile and each covariate.
Specific covariates can be selected and SE can also be displayed.
